         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Alice Millikin,</hi> Condemned the laſt Seſſions for High-Treaſon, ſhe Confeſſed the Fact; ſhe was about Forty Years of Age, ſhe was Born in <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> and was brought up to make Gloves: She alſo Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a Glover in that Country; where they lived ſome time, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards (as ſhe told the <hi>Ordinary</hi>) her Hu<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

David Millikin,</hi> who alſo was Condemned the laſt Seſſions for the ſame Fact, but hath ſince recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Majeſties moſt Gracious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve: He was Bred up to the Trade o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a Glover.</p>
            <p>She ſaid, <hi>That ſhe often prayed to G<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d to change her husbands heart, and to Reform his wicked Life:</hi> But good Counſel made him more Obſtinate and Averſe from his Duty to God and Man.</p>
            <p>After a conſiderable waiting for his Amendment (but in vain) She left dwelling with him, and came to <hi>London,</hi> where ſhe was frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hired to Waſh and Scoure, and ſometimes to be a Nurſe keeping; But Poverty grew upon her, and with it a Covetous mind, ſo falling into Bad Acquaintance, ſhe loſt her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Employment, and living idly, ſhe met with one Mrs. <hi>Chaſton,</hi> who uſed the wicked Art of Clipping, and is not yet Apprehended. She ſaid ſhe knew no more of the Gang; but the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Chaſton,</hi> inticed her to aſſiſt her in Clipping: At laſt ſhe ſet up the Practice of it her ſel<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; which ſhe now Laments too late, but Begs God's and the King's Pardon of it.</p>
            <p>She was much troubled, that ſhe had been very neglective of God's Law<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and breaking the Sabbath, and that ſhe hath not at any time adheared to the motions of God's Spirit, nor improved the Opportunities ſhe had, tending toward Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That ſhe is now truly ſorry, that ſhe bath miſpent ſo much precious time and delay'd her Repentance, and that were it to be Redeemed, ſhe would give all the World, were it in her Power.</hi>

I mention this, becauſe <hi>Alice Millikin</hi> the Clipper, was very much affected with that Diſcourſe, and that Prayer made in her behalf. Indeed ſhe appeared very penitent at any time when ſhe was prayed withal: And ſince the few days reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite ſhe hath had, more than ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; the <hi>Ordinary</hi> askt her, if that Favour did not make her ſecure as if ſhe ſhould not Dye.</p>

            <p>She anſwered, No; She bleſs'd God, she had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Time, having been extraordinary earneſt in Prayer, and doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely deſire to Repent thorowly of all her Sins ſe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ret and known. The <hi>Ordinary</hi> was early with her on <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> the day of her <hi>Execution,</hi> and exhorted her not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her ſelf with falſe hopes of a Bleſſed eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>He inſtructed her more fully in the Nature of True Faith and Repentance, and inquired many things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to her Soul, which were too long here to give an Account of.</p>
            <p>She ſaid, after I had prayed a conſiderable time with her; that ſhe was much troubled about the manner of her Death; yet ſaid, that ſhe hoped the Lord would rowl away the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of it, becauſe ſhe truely deſired to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to him; And though ſhe had not that Aſſurance of God's love, which ſhe longed after, yet ſhe bleſs'd the, Lord she had inward ſupport of mind by clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to Chriſt in her Death. She hoped he had made ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to Gods offended Juſtice for all her provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Him. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd they had been many and great, and deſired to Mourn that she could grieve no more for every ſin, which she endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to call to mind, and be rightly penitent for.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ordinary</hi> ſtaid with her till the Sheriffs Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers came to demand her. Then about Ten of the Clock she went on foot, guarded to the place of Execution in <hi>Smithfield.</hi> I went along with her thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: She exhorted the People to take Warning by her, not to offend in the ſame, or any other way againſt the known Laws: she pray'd for her ſelf, and the <hi>Ordinary</hi> after that pray'd for her, and endeavour'd to comfort her, for she ſeemed very peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Afterward she went to the Pedſtall, and was faſtned by a Rope to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34185:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 45 -->Stake, with an Iron Hoop about her middle, that she might ſink through into the pile of Fire, after she was ſtifled.</p>
            <p>She warned all to beware of a Covetous heart, and in poverty not to diſtruſt God's Providence, but to fear and ſerve Him, and then the like fatal end will not attend them.</p>
            <p>After this I took my Farewell of her, and left her to be executed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law.</p>
